# DataStructures and Algorithms

**Version 1.0.32**

Repo of all of my implementations of the various Data Structures and Algorithms done in Java. All implementations have the output in comment block towards end of code.

## List of Data Structures Implemented:
- Array
- ArrayList (Dynamic Array)
- LinkedLists (Singly, Doubly, Circular Singly, Circular Doubly)
- Stacks (Array-based, LinkedList-based)
- Queues (Array-based, LinkedList-based, Circular Queue Array)
- HashTables (Open Addressing: Linear Probing, Closed Addressing: Separate Chaining using LinkedLists)
- Trees (Generic Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Binary MinHeap, Binary MaxHeap, Trie)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix (unweighed directed graph), Adjacency List(unweighed undirected/directed graph))

## List of Algorithms Implemented:
- Breadth First Search/Traversal (for Graph:Adjacency List)
- Depth First Search/Traversal (for Graph:Adjacency List)
- Binary Search (Recursive/Iterative)
- Linear Search
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
